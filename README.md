# ☞ About

Pomo-LaBeouf is a Shia LaBeouf themed Pomodoro technique website.

#### What is the Pomodoro technique?

It's a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Personally, it helps me focus.

#### Why Shia LaBeouf?

I'm a big fan of his "JUST DO IT" ~~inspirational speech~~ meme, and I strongly believe his wise words can help motivate other people.

# Goals

This is my first personal coding project.  
At that time I was mainly experimenting with making a website more interactive using plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
Breaking it down to the specifics:

- Practice the HTML, CSS and Javascript skills I had learned so far at Codecademy;
- Expand my knowledge on Git & Github;
- Play with DOM Objects and different types of media;
- Experiment with event listeners – specially for the 'following eyes' feature.
- Explore CSS positioning and displaying, as well as media queries;

# Features

- Functioning timer with start, stop, resume and short/long intervals buttons;
- Random Shia sound bits for when clicking 'just do it' and stop buttons;
- Muting feature, in case you're tired of hearing Shia's voice.
- Several random backgrounds to make the whole experience even weirder;
- Cursor-following eyes to give it some extra creepyiness.
